# DLA3D
## Fizbit 2014 contest

### For what?
Application developed for a contest popularizing physics through software - educational, games, animations, etc.

### What does DLA3D show?
Phenomena of Diffusion-limited Aggregation in three dimensions.

> A DLA cluster grown from a copper sulfate solution in an electrodeposition cell
Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles.

### What technologies?
Unity3D with C#

### My thoughts
The project is not a pinnacle of Unity apss development, but it shows the growth of a cluster.
Camera and lightning should be definitely improved. The code has a lot of redundancy as well.
